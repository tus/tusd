# Local disk storage

Tusd can store uploads on the local disk in a specific directory. This storage backend is the default if no other configuration flags are supplied. The `-upload-dir` flag specifies the directory that will be used. If this directory does not exist, tusd will create it. For example:

```sh
$ tusd -upload-dir=./uploads
```

When a new upload is created, for example with the upload ID `abcdef123`, tusd creates two files:

- `./uploads/abcdef123` to hold the file content that is uploaded
- `./uploads/abcdef123.info` to hold [meta information about the upload](/storage-backends/overview/#storage-format)

## Issues with NFS and shared folders

Tusd maintains [upload locks](/advanced-topics/locks/) on disk to ensure exclusive access to uploads and prevent data corruption. These disk-based locks utilize hard links, which might not supported by older NFS versions or when a folder is shared in a VM using VirtualBox or Vagrant. In these cases, you might get errors like this:

```
TemporaryErrors (Lockfile created, but doesn't exist)
```

We recommend you to ensure that your file system supports hard links, use a different file system, or use one of tusd's cloud storage abilities. If the problem still persists, please open a bug report.
