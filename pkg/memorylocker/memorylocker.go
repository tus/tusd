// Package memorylocker provides an in-memory locking mechanism.
//
// When multiple processes are attempting to access an upload, whether it be
// by reading or writing, a synchronization mechanism is required to prevent
// data corruption, especially to ensure correct offset values and the proper
// order of chunks inside a single upload.
//
// MemoryLocker persists locks using memory and therefore allowing a simple and
// cheap mechanism. Locks will only exist as long as this object is kept in
// reference and will be erased if the program exits.
//
// If somebody tries to acquire a lock that is already held, the `requestRelease`
// callback will be invoked that was provided when the lock was successfully
// acquired the first time. The lock holder should then cease its operation and
// release the lock properly, so somebody else can acquire it.
