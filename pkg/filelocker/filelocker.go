// Package filelocker provide an upload locker based on the local file system.
//
// It provides an exclusive upload locking mechanism using lock files
// which are stored on disk. Each of them stores the PID of the process which
// acquired the lock. This allows locks to be automatically freed when a process
// is unable to release it on its own because the process is not alive anymore.
// For more information, consult the documentation for handler.LockerDataStore
// interface, which is implemented by FileLocker.
//
// If somebody tries to acquire a lock that is already held, the `requestRelease`
// callback will be invoked that was provided when the lock was successfully
// acquired the first time. The lock holder should then cease its operation and
// release the lock properly, so somebody else can acquire it. Under the hood, this
// is implemented using an additional file. When an already held lock should be
// released, a `.stop` file is created on disk. The lock holder regularly checks
// if this file exists. If so, it will call its `requestRelease` function.
