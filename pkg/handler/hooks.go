	// The reason is that we want stores to be able to continue processing a request after
	// its context has been cancelled. For example, assume a PATCH request is incoming. If
	// the end-user pauses the upload, the connection is closed causing the request context
	// to be cancelled immediately. However, we want the store to be able to save the last
	// few bytes that were transmitted before the request was aborted. To allow this, we
	// copy the request context but cancel it with a brief delay to give the data store
	// time to finish its operations.
