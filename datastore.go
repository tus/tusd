	// Write the chunk read from src into the file specified by the id at the
	// given offset. The handler will take care of validating the offset and

	// return an os.ErrNotExist which will be interpretet as a 404 Not Found.
	// It will also lock resources while they are written to ensure only one
	// write happens per time.

	// should not be enabled any call to GetReader should return
	// tusd.ErrNotImplemented. The length of the resource is determined by
	// retrieving the offset using GetInfo.
	// If the returned reader also implements the io.Closer interface, the
	// Close() method will be invoked once everything has been read.
	GetReader(id string) (io.Reader, error)
	// Terminate an upload so any further requests to the resource, both reading
	// and writing, must return os.ErrNotExist or similar.
	Terminate(id string) error
	// Lock the upload file for writing. This feature is not part of the
	// official TUS specification. Handlers should call this prior to writing
	// chunks or terminating files. Returns true if the file lock has been
	// acquired.
	LockFile(id string) (bool, error)
	// Unlock the upload file for writing. This feature is not part of the
	// official TUS specification. Handlers should defer calls to this after
